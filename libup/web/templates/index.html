<h1>LibUp</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        LibUp (aka libraryupgrader) tracks dependencies in code we use and bumps them
        as necessary.

        Currently focusing on PHP and nodejs repositories, with more planned.

        It is currently tracking {{count}} repositories and {{upstreams}} libraries across the following branches: {{', '.join(BRANCHES)}}.
        The configuration may be viewed on <a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/g/labs/libraryupgrader/config/+/refs/heads/master">Gerrit</a>.
